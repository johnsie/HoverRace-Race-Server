# HoverRace-Race-Server

I've been doing a bit of expermenting with sockets and eventually want to implement a centralised server for hosting races.

This project is a hobby project for learning about tcp sockets and c++ and is not intended to replace the current Steamworks based approach used by the Steam version of HoverRace.
